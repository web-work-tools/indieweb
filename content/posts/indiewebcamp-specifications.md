## [What are IndieWebCamp specifications](https://indieweb.org/FAQ#What_are_IndieWebCamp_specifications)

> "Q: What specs does IndieWebCamp handle?"

A: The IndieWebCamp community develops several widely implemented specifications, including [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), and [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub). Additional specifications (like [Vouch](https://indieweb.org/Vouch)) are in development. Lastly, IndieWebCamp also makes heavy (re-)use of [microformats](https://indieweb.org/microformats) specifications.

See [specifications](https://indieweb.org/specifications) for a longer list of essential IndieWebCamp specifications, both developed here in the community, and heavily (re-)used from other communities. 

## [Indieweb Specifications](https://indieweb.org/specifications)

The following specifications are used for dependable interoperability by the IndieWebCamp community.

Broadly implemented: These standards are interoperably implemented by the overwhelming majority of indieweb software, services, and websites:

* IndieAuth (W3C Note)
* microformats2
  * h-card
  * h-entry
  * h-feed
* Micropub (W3C Recommendation)
* rel-me
* Webmention (W3C Recommendation)
* WebSub (W3C Recommendation)

Numerous implementations: These standards have several implementations that interoperate, enough to consider the specifications fairly stable:

* authorship
* h-cite
* h-event

Being implemented / in development: These standards are undergoing active development and evolution as they are being implemented, tested in actual products with users, and then iterated for improvement:

* fragmentions
* Microsub
* original-post-discovery
* post-type-discovery (W3C Note)
* salmentions
* vouch

Stable with some support: These standards are stable (few or no changes in quite some time), yet only have some support, or are only supported by publishers:

* XFN (beyond rel=me) - many sites publish, no known consuming applications

Per IndieWebCamp principles, microformats specifications are (re-)used heavily as essential simple building block extensions to HTML.

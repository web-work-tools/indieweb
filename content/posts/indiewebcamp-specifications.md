## [What are IndieWebCamp specifications](https://indieweb.org/FAQ#What_are_IndieWebCamp_specifications)

> "Q: What specs does IndieWebCamp handle?"

A: The IndieWebCamp community develops several widely implemented specifications, including [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), and [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub). Additional specifications (like [Vouch](https://indieweb.org/Vouch)) are in development. Lastly, IndieWebCamp also makes heavy (re-)use of [microformats](https://indieweb.org/microformats) specifications.

See [specifications](https://indieweb.org/specifications) for a longer list of essential IndieWebCamp specifications, both developed here in the community, and heavily (re-)used from other communities. 

## [Indieweb Specifications](https://indieweb.org/specifications)

The following specifications are used for dependable interoperability by the IndieWebCamp community.

Broadly implemented: These standards are interoperably implemented by the overwhelming majority of indieweb software, services, and websites:

* [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth) (W3C Note)
* [microformats2](https://indieweb.org/microformats2)
  * [h-card](https://indieweb.org/h-card)
  * [h-entry](https://indieweb.org/h-entry)
  * [h-feed](https://indieweb.org/h-feed)
* [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) (W3C Recommendation)
* [rel-me](https://indieweb.org/rel-me)
* [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) (W3C Recommendation)
* [WebSub](https://indieweb.org/WebSub) (W3C Recommendation)

Numerous implementations: These standards have several implementations that interoperate, enough to consider the specifications fairly stable:

* [authorship](https://indieweb.org/authorship)
* [h-cite](https://indieweb.org/h-cite)
* [h-event](https://indieweb.org/h-event)

Being implemented / in development: These standards are undergoing active development and evolution as they are being implemented, tested in actual products with users, and then iterated for improvement:

* [fragmentions](https://indieweb.org/fragmentions)
* [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub)
* [original-post-discovery](https://indieweb.org/original-post-discovery)
* [post-type-discovery](https://indieweb.org/post-type-discovery) (W3C Note)
* [salmentions](https://indieweb.org/salmentions)
* [vouch](https://indieweb.org/vouch)

Stable with some support: These standards are stable (few or no changes in quite some time), yet only have some support, or are only supported by publishers:

* [XFN](https://indieweb.org/XFN) (beyond rel=me) - many sites publish, no known consuming applications

Per IndieWebCamp [principles](/indiewebcamp/principles-unpacked/), microformats specifications are (re-)used heavily as essential simple building block extensions to HTML.

I made a test branch for the swapping jekyll for hugo article, and then merged the changes back to master, once I had it running.

## Checkout test branch

Use the command `git checkout -b` will allow you to create a local branch for testing.

I will call my new branch `test-hugo` so the command will be like so:

`git checkout -b test-hugo`

Git keeps track of all your files, but not just the files, but everything in the repository. 

Every commit, git remembers.

> "yes yes I know"

However, it really boggled my mind the first time I tried it locally. 

I can change to a branch or another point in the history of this repository, and git tucks away the one I'm working on... and the whole directory changes and like wait... 

>where did all my files just go? 

When you push a repository to GitHub they keep a copy too.. but git is really awesome beyond github. If it was invented today they would call it a blockchain :rofl:

### Git is Magic!

it sure feels that way, especially the first time I realized what it was doing. I still have a sense of wonder and mystery around Git.

You probably knowbut you don't need github at all, and I'm learning that a significant portion, of git repositories are never exposed to the public.

`git checkout -b` is just the same as creating a new directory, copy pasting the repo files there to test, and testing it out there. Except git makes it look like magic, and keeps track of your progress!

The IndieWeb organization decided against youtube this year, and I can understand why. However, Twitch is not easy to embed from, and youtube offers autotranscription, which is very useful and relies on sophisticated AI.. not something I can spin up from a [BASH shell](https://web-work.tools/command-line-git-ssh).

So I [grabbed the audio](https://www.locoloader.com/twitch-video-downloader/) from twitch and [converted to mp4](https://windowsloop.com/download-m3u8-video-with-ffmpeg/) with `ffmpeg` and put it on youtube, so I could take advantage of the easy embed, and autotranscription.

For now I have youtube embed, because this is a big image... but am compressing it to see about hosting it here. Mostly I'm concerned with the UX, where hosting locally would look nice to not have youtube logos, it also puts the burden on me of how to treat the file so the user has an ideal experience of it.

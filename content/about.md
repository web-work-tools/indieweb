This site is built with the Indigo, an IndieWeb theme for Hugo.

Everything I personally publish is public-domain informational resources. Ideally they will grow to include enough participants to become self-sustaining, after a while.

Mainly, I'm just using these spaces as my classroom and playground. A copule more years of this and I'll have more than enough valuable skills and knowledge, and the world will be better for it.

One nice feature of having so many organizations is I can for a repository into the appropriate one, and make it easier for folk to browse through. I'll have a post about all that soon enough.

When there is audio that contains valuable information that should be available in print, I work on annotated, web-marked up, transcriptions.

DIDecentral has the most "legs", of any of them, with a large userbase and a few individuals who are beginning to take a more active role in the website(s).

This organization is all about learning to create a vendor agnostic, widely interoperable, decentralized internet identity layer for people organizations and things.

Right now using the Indigo Hugo theme, that supports indieweb features.

>you can see, eventually this will be 5 domains with infominer.id becoming the home page for all of it, web-work.tools, didecentral.com \ decentralized-id.com, SourceCrypto.pub, learncryptotrading.co.

Now its true.

I use https://sourcecrypto.pub for all of my crypto related content, https://learncryptotrading.co for my trading content, https://decentralized-id.com is currently the decentralized-id site, but I like DIDecentral better... when its ready. And yes... https://web-work.tools.

I have ambitious plans... but I think those domains should keep me busy for the time-being.

## 4 GitHub Organizations to Rule Them

  * https://github.com/didecentral - [decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com)
  * https://github.com/sourcecrypto - [sourcecrypto.pub](https://sourcecrypto.pub)
    * https://github.com/sourcecrypto/bitcoin-history - [sourcecrypto.pub/bitcoin-history](https://sourcecrypto.pub/bitcoin-history)
    * https://github.com/sourcecrypto/transcripts - [sourcecrypto.pub/transcripts](https://sourcecrypto.pub/transcripts)
    * https://github.com/sourcecrypto/decentralized-web - [sourcecrypto.pub/decentralized-web](https://sourcecrypto.pub/decentralized-web)
  * https://github.com/learn-crypto-trading - [learncryptotrading.co](https://learncryptotrading.co)
  * https://github.com/web-work-tools - [web-work.tools](https://web-work.tools)

Everything I personally publish is public-domain informational resources. Ideally they will grow to include enough participants to become self-sustaining, after a while.

Mainly, I'm just using these spaces as my classroom and playground. A copule more years of this and I'll have more than enough valuable skills and knowledge, and the world will be better for it.

One nice feature of having so many organizations is I can for a repository into the appropriate one, and make it easier for folk to browse through. I'll have a post about all that soon enough.

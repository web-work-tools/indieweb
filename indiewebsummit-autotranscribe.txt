09:14

09:20
up here
19:56
[Music]
20:12
minor technical issues
20:50
I know
21:12
of course I'm running nightly so it has
21:15
to go update itself okay
21:43
there goes you know you gotta run with
21:49
the latest bill just in case alright
21:54
while that's loading welcome to the
21:56
ninth annual indie web summit I'm when a
22:05
organizers taunted Charlie this is Terry
22:07
Miller Aaron Preki organizers you'll
22:14
notice this year that we have
22:15
color-coded lanyards that's new what
22:19
does this mean let me just go over that
22:21
since that's one of the first things
22:22
you've seen purple or more like a
22:26
lavender
22:27
I'd say means we're an organizer and you
22:30
can contact us for anything that is not
22:33
awesome like we really an really mean
22:35
that I will be showing you our code of
22:37
conduct shortly but if there's anything
22:43
that you're concerned just like where's
22:46
the bathroom like we have one bathroom
22:48
around the side here more in the hallway
22:51
we ran out of supplies questions about
22:54
the facility questions about what can
22:58
you do can you get back in schedule etc
22:59
you can contact us all right what's
23:06
projectors for the last time I presents
23:10
it I actually had audio problems so this
23:16
time of course video problems
23:19
and now let's see if we can actually
23:22
present you something that looks like
23:25
something that you're at alright you
23:28
should be seeing a wiki page 2019 all
23:32
right that's a great start so I'll keep
23:37
the intro section fairly short because
23:39
we have some awesome keynotes lined up
23:41
introduce you to the organizers we do
23:44
have a code of conduct
23:53
and we take it very seriously so this is
23:55
something that we have worked on over
23:56
the years we are committed to keeping
23:59
indie web camp and you Web Summit all
24:02
indie web events safe and inclusive by
24:06
design by default and so we documental
24:09
but what that means in short it means
24:12
treat each other respectfully it also
24:14
means that harassment will not be
24:16
tolerated if you have any issues or
24:20
problems with that you are encouraged to
24:24
contact one of the organizers and we are
24:27
all listed on the 20 19 page directly
24:31
there's a phone number for you right
24:34
Aaron and there's one piece that we've
24:48
added which is new which any of us in
24:52
fact any organizer you see in fact
24:53
there's a bunch of community and do web
24:56
organizers here if I can just get you
24:58
all to at least stand up well the real
25:03
community organizers stand up yes thank
25:05
you and raise your hands
25:09
so weep and we spent half a day
25:11
yesterday in a new web organizer summit
25:13
and one of the things we did was we
25:14
updated the code of conduct with a
25:18
section from xoxo code of conduct which
25:21
is basically that the indie web we
25:24
prioritized marginalized people's safety
25:26
over privileged people's comfort and
25:30
there's a bunch of text there I have it
25:32
scrolled up about you know you're
25:36
serving the right to not act on
25:37
complaints regarding reverse systems and
25:39
reasonable communicates the boundaries
25:40
or accumulation of tone you don't find
25:42
congenial or even criticizing of bad
25:45
behavior itself so we found that pretty
25:47
inspiring from xoxo we're happy to
25:49
follow that paragraph that's new since
25:51
you also probably signed up agree to it
25:54
if you have any questions about that at
25:55
all those organized you saw stand up or
25:57
the three of us up here
25:59
and happy to answer that we don't
26:01
foresee it being an issue but bringing
26:03
it up is the way we make sure that
26:05
that's that's how that goes okay that's
26:08
enough on that in addition to the code
26:10
of conduct for any web we're at in
26:12
Missoula facility so you've hopefully
26:14
read them as low communication
26:15
participation guidelines very similar
26:18
covering a lot of anti-harassment along
26:22
many different ways and those are all
26:26
linked from the home page of 2019 so
26:28
from right here you can find that indie
26:31
web dot org slash 2019 great next we
26:36
have a photo policy your lanyards is you
26:40
came in or either black by default or if
26:43
you chose a lanyard that's yellow and
26:45
you see someone's heel down there that
26:46
means that please ask me before taking
26:48
my photo and then of course if they say
26:51
no you gotta respect that even if
26:54
someone else has taken their photo that
26:55
doesn't give you permission to take
26:57
their photo you have to ask if it's R if
26:59
they're land you're just red that means
27:01
do not take their photo and please try
27:03
to see if I need group what do you take
27:05
you can crop them out like literally
27:07
while you're taking the photo make sure
27:09
that they're not in it if at all
27:10
possible I think that's the photo policy
27:15
all right
27:16
live stream so we have a live stream in
27:18
here by default for this morning we also
27:21
so if you don't want to be in that you
27:24
should be sitting in the back rows so
27:27
that's that's pretty simple there later
27:30
on we'll have sessions in the rooms
27:31
three of which have video will describe
27:33
how that works in the afternoon so that
27:35
you'll have plenty of warning and be
27:38
able to choose accordingly stickers and
27:41
pronouns please use the pronoun pins
27:43
near the registration you should have
27:44
picked one up and please use people's
27:47
pronouns that they are wearing I don't
27:50
think there's much more to that let's we
27:53
have several tools in particular during
27:56
the summit so make your experience the
27:57
best slack slash IRC this wiki and the
28:03
etherpad so those are all linked to from
28:08
here as well in the participating
28:09
section
28:12
so those are the baseline tools and
28:16
rules the overview of the day is aha we
28:21
have a schedule look at that we're only
28:23
about five minutes behind okay we are
28:26
here approximately we are live-streaming
28:28
this on Twitch so people are remotely
28:31
participating in including the chat
28:33
channels probably about what's 30
28:34
signups remotely okay so the chats gonna
28:38
be pretty busy during this conference
28:40
use the main chat for anything about the
28:42
conference like itself content all that
28:44
they're saying logistics issues or
28:46
questions about structure or whatever
28:48
there's the meta channel for discussing
28:50
that and we ask that any development
28:52
related questions and discussions go to
28:54
the dev channel so if you find yourself
28:56
typing in a piece of jargon like
28:57
microformats or web mention please move
29:01
that discussion for development channel
29:02
keep the main channel focused on hey
29:04
this is my indie website I want to do
29:06
cool stuff with it like the following or
29:08
you know can someone show me how to do
29:10
something alright that's dance
29:14
we have great keynotes coming up then at
29:21
11:00 we'll do optional lightning intros
29:23
and personal site demos we have a lot of
29:26
people here so we probably won't be able
29:27
to do everyone but usually it's a fairly
29:31
self-selected crowd will give you up to
29:32
two minutes to do a quick demo of your
29:36
site if you can keep it to under one
29:37
that's even better
29:38
we'll see let's we've done this before
29:40
it's kind of chaotic but it mostly works
29:43
we'll do that for an hour it'll go by
29:45
super fast do a group photo we'll eat
29:48
lunch outside there's a bunch of options
29:51
for lunch actually listed in the
29:52
schedule we're not all nearby and then
29:55
we'll reconvene here at 1:30 the doors
29:58
will open to return at 1:15 any
30:01
questions so far ok thanks so much to
30:08
our sponsors for making this possible
30:13
so we have Mozilla to thank for the
30:15
space and the food we have named com2
30:18
thanks for last night's pre-party and
30:20
social thanks very much name calm and
30:22
octa and open collective contributions
30:25
for general sponsorship there is help us
30:27
out with various things I want to
30:29
especially thank all of you who signed
30:31
up as individual contributors and added
30:33
to the Travel Assistance Fund because
30:35
that money was matched by a anonymous
30:38
donor and we were able to get several
30:40
people here then we wouldn't have
30:42
otherwise been able to do so thank you
30:44
very much for everyone was able to do
30:45
that alright if that is the last thing
30:55
then
31:18
there we go alright I think we're good
31:21
with organized session I'm gonna give
31:24
you a really really brief state of the
31:25
indie web because we are running short
31:26
on time I'm gonna cut my time short
31:29
because you we have some amazing keynote
31:31
speakers lined up with incredible
31:34
stories to tell
31:34
so the I want to talk a little bit about
31:38
the accomplishments the last year some
31:41
of the products you've made some and
31:42
some of the challenges and cutting edge
31:45
things that are coming to the forefront
31:47
that maybe we can discuss the next two
31:50
days so we got some amazing press this
31:54
past year India web has hit the
31:56
mainstream The New Yorker covered an
31:58
article literally titled can't Indy
32:00
social media save us and essentially
32:03
immediately referenced like the indie
32:05
web right look at many web there it is
32:07
the term indie web camel cops and all
32:11
mainstream media right they've gotten it
32:14
they'd spelled it right they kept it as
32:16
one word amazing okay so if you haven't
32:20
seen their article I highly recommend
32:21
reading it it's not an entirely
32:23
technical accurate but that's okay
32:24
because the overall story they're
32:26
telling is the right story and they're
32:28
getting more and more people interested
32:30
we sold out indie web summit which I
32:32
don't think we've ever done before
32:37
what's our what's our current count on
32:41
the sign-up sheet anyone know last I
32:43
checked it was 47 of you were here okay
32:49
okay so that's been awesome we have more
32:54
homebrew how many 46
33:01
did we count a blank line or something
33:05
okay that's allowed we have many more
33:10
home bruh website club cities that are
33:12
regularly meeting and a whole bunch
33:13
getting started just this past week
33:15
Barnsley I don't even know where that is
33:18
sorry American geography all that I
33:20
think it's in England I believe
33:23
announced that they're starting there
33:25
Andy what their home website club on the
33:27
18th of July so that's pretty cool we
33:30
are have more more in the webcams we've
33:33
scheduled lots of a new about camps this
33:36
year and are on track to schedule a
33:37
record number this year in record number
33:39
of different cities as well so that's
33:41
pretty cool
33:42
aside from the community participation
33:45
Ryan Barrett who runs the service called
33:48
bridge II which I'm sure a lot of you
33:50
are using how are you using bridging
33:52
let's just see yeah a lot of your users
33:54
shared some stats for us on the
33:56
continued essentially what you can see
33:58
here is linear organic growth of the
34:01
indie web this is one of the things that
34:03
we're actually really proud of that we
34:05
are not looking for some sort of like
34:07
hockey stick unicorn
34:09
VC driven like stratospheric like it's
34:12
like you know rise and explode and blow
34:14
up into splinters type movement we're
34:16
trying to grow ourselves sustainably
34:18
which i think is becoming a common theme
34:20
in many areas you know like the
34:21
environment and I'm really proud that
34:24
this has happened you can see that's
34:26
been a couple of drop offs in Mike users
34:29
by feature etc and those are for can
34:33
anyone guess what happened in August of
34:34
last year
34:37
thankfully Facebook filled its API so
34:41
that obviously dropped off with a lot of
34:43
back feed and like I personally stopped
34:45
posting to Facebook then the second drop
34:47
off happened when Google killed G+ so
34:49
you know Facebook and then G+ there were
34:54
apparently quite a few completion G+ but
34:56
as you can see the stats overall if kept
34:57
rising the number of users number of web
35:00
mentions sent this is this is the one
35:02
particularly proud of is the number
35:04
weapons just said continue to keep
35:05
growing and the number of unique domains
35:06
so that's the best indicator we have for
35:09
like how many people are using bridge II
35:11
as the representation a subset of like
35:13
the whole indie web we know that that's
35:15
like maybe I don't know somewhere
35:17
between 1 to 10 percent we don't have
35:19
accurate stats it would be great if we
35:20
did but relative growth is always a good
35:23
thing to see like that alright so those
35:26
are awesome things that have happened
35:28
the things we're making progress on
35:30
travel assistance last year we were late
35:33
to do this we were able to offer one
35:35
scholarship and we weren't able to
35:37
arrange logistics in time so this year
35:40
we did it more in advance we were able
35:43
to offer a number of scholarships and
35:45
have three individuals able to accept
35:47
plan and show up today so we think
35:50
that's a huge increase and we can do
35:57
better so we organized some have
36:01
definitely pledged to do better next
36:02
year for organizing travel assistance
36:05
far more in advance we're also looking
36:08
into seeing if there's a way to provide
36:10
travel assistance to other indie web
36:11
camps because one of the things we
36:14
realized was hey maybe it's better
36:16
environmentally to fly people or train
36:18
people closer to where they live rather
36:21
than try to fly everyone across the
36:22
entire world to one location so we're
36:26
gonna be investigating that that's
36:28
something we make progress on can make
36:29
better progress on we've got some
36:33
challenges that we've incurred and last
36:36
that we still keep running into and the
36:38
biggest one that we've noticed this year
36:40
is wordpress and wordpress comm so
36:42
there's a number of folks that tried to
36:45
post RSVPs and things didn't quite work
36:47
right because
36:49
maybe they're picking different theme or
36:50
because wordpress.com updated it
36:53
continues to be a source of challenges
36:55
and I just think we should admit that
36:57
and find bold solutions to figuring out
37:00
how we can get that approximately 30% of
37:03
the web to actually engage with us we've
37:09
got a lot of solutions there we can do
37:11
better it's definitely a challenge
37:12
all right and that leads me to the last
37:14
piece which is technical areas of
37:15
exploration I picked out three areas
37:18
which I thought I heard lots of
37:19
discussion about just to raise up - you
37:21
think I start thinking about these are
37:23
areas that we don't have clear
37:24
inoperability on the web yet but we
37:27
could maybe even starting this weekend
37:29
this is the kind of thing that's
37:30
happened every year people have come up
37:32
with like an area they're interested in
37:34
and make something work that didn't work
37:35
before the first is private posts or
37:37
groups this is one of the top reasons I
37:40
still hear from people for using
37:41
Facebook is that it offers a convenient
37:43
you I'm for sharing things privately
37:46
with either individuals or with small
37:48
groups of people it's something that I
37:50
think we can do in our own sites it's
37:52
something that still needs figuring out
37:53
UX protocols but I think we can solve it
37:56
like we've solved all our previous use
37:58
cases
37:59
the second is payments you know if if we
38:05
want to make progress in payments we
38:07
want to figure out a way for people to
38:08
actually transact peer-to-peer and maybe
38:10
not necessarily depend on a new
38:12
centralized currency driven by a large
38:16
social media company and a bunch of
38:19
blockchain companies and a bunch of
38:21
credit card companies maybe that's not
38:23
the best thing for the planet and for
38:25
independence and for liberty and all the
38:27
things that we talked about so how do we
38:29
handle payments and offering services on
38:33
the indie web we're getting paid for
38:34
stuff whether it's like paid for
38:35
articles or paid for like you know
38:37
podcasts or whatever your content I
38:40
think that's an area that is worth
38:41
exploring and the last one is discovery
38:44
this has always been a bit of a
38:46
challenge and now that we have indie web
38:49
readers social readers I feel like the
38:51
next step is finding a way for folks to
38:54
discover each other people they might
38:56
want to follow other kinds of things
38:59
finds that in the community and connect
39:01
that are a bit ad hoc
39:03
right now and I think that there's
39:04
there's a lot of potential for progress
39:05
here so that's it for the state of the
39:08
indie web 2019 I'm going to stop here
39:10
and introduce you to our first official
39:14
keynote speaker since I feel like I'm
39:16
just your organize for giving you the
39:17
updates and that's kit Hudson my name is
39:42
spelled correctly which happens so
39:43
infrequently I'm displaying this but not
39:46
wearing it we start our journey with our
39:54
world shaking with nothing but
39:56
contractions in that it explodes into an
39:59
immeasurable expanse and we're left in
40:02
cycles of contractions and expansions
40:04
until like Hamlet we shuffle off this
40:07
mortal coil coil because fundamentally
40:11
this is what life is about it is about a
40:14
series of contractions and expansions we
40:18
start off small unsure excited and
40:22
interested in everything we take our
40:25
first steps we learn we expand we fall
40:30
down and we're yelled at don't get that
40:32
don't do that don't do that I live in
40:34
either and we contract we try again and
40:37
we explore we taste everything we watch
40:42
we continue to learn we expand in the
40:47
joy of this existence and then we touch
40:51
the hot plate coil we contract
40:58
in time we try again we make friends we
41:03
explore with these friends and we expand
41:05
and then we lose friends we sit in our
41:09
ball of pain and our world becomes
41:11
smaller we contract a little bit more we
41:15
fall in love and the world expands and
41:18
it is beautiful gorgeous and our hearts
41:24
we're told that it gets better hold on
41:27
we survive we start to thrive and we
41:31
expand again life happens life is this
41:35
cycle one after another we have new
41:38
schools we have new friends we have
41:40
marriages we have births we have
41:42
adoptions we have breakups we have new
41:44
homes we have new jobs new states new
41:47
countries new bosses old hang-ups
41:49
death loss cancer disability job loss
41:53
the unforeseen and the unplanned and we
41:56
withdraw from the world and then we find
41:59
our causes or sometimes our causes come
42:02
and find us we explore our world and we
42:06
expand we are sometimes criticized for
42:10
our gender or our non gender for the
42:13
color of our hair or the color of our
42:15
skin for simply being who we are as if
42:19
being ourselves is somehow wrong we know
42:22
it isn't but we contract into ourselves
42:24
nonetheless and then we find our tribe
42:29
those who understand the parts of us the
42:32
parts of us that are beautiful the parts
42:34
of us that should be without shame the
42:36
parts of us that simply are and we can
42:39
be ourselves and in that comfort and the
42:41
strength of our tribe we expand again we
42:45
have expectations
42:46
I need come on how hard can it be but we
42:52
share we give our creations life we give
42:56
to the community we give to the world
42:58
and we get crap back there's this bug
43:01
there's this flaw it isn't perfect
43:03
you're not perfect we aren't perfect we
43:07
contract
43:07
we grudgingly give our time to those who
43:11
demand it and we joyfully give it to
43:13
those who understand the gift that our
43:17
time is we who create create because we
43:21
can't not create we made this creation
43:24
to exist
43:26
we need this object this project this
43:28
process to live we will it into creation
43:32
and we expand mishaps befall us and we
43:37
break in that breaking me hurts
43:40
and in that hurting we contract and then
43:43
we heal and in that healing we realize
43:46
the gift that our breaking had the gift
43:49
the story the lesson we expand again we
43:55
realized that we cannot change human
43:57
nature there will always be jerks
43:59
there'll always be trolls and there will
44:01
always be assholes
44:03
we will there will always be those who
44:05
choose to destroy instead of to create
44:07
and with this knowledge once again we
44:10
contract until we realize that why we
44:14
cannot change human nature we can
44:17
influence human behavior we can
44:20
demonstrate what a good person is with
44:22
our actions with our demonstrations with
44:25
our understanding and with our empathy
44:26
we expand and how easy is it in these
44:31
expansions to flitter out into the silos
44:33
to share our lives the silos are easy
44:36
they are popular and they are cool we
44:39
want to be cool so we make connections
44:42
and we join new networks and we expand
44:45
again we trade privacy for that ease we
44:51
hand our data over we expand some way
44:54
even though we lose a little bit and we
44:57
can justify that a little bit that's
44:59
just a small amount of loss right we can
45:01
report all the ads as spam I do this on
45:05
Instagram so that we aren't a sentiment
45:09
on some reach research scale somewhere
45:12
we opt out so that we aren't told what
45:15
to think
45:16
which person or mistake to pile on on
45:19
Twitter's out
45:22
and we can pretend all we want in these
45:24
silos but we lose ourselves we lose
45:27
ourselves just a little bit every time
45:29
because the only way to know the true
45:32
arc of our story the only way to
45:35
understand the true depth of our
45:37
experiences the only way to come to the
45:39
true understanding of our own hero's
45:41
journey is if we have all the parts when
45:46
our data is siloed behind a login page
45:49
when our data is lost by a company that
45:51
has sold or goes under or they base
45:54
diamond your data is just gone
45:56
we lose a part of our own story we
45:59
become the blind man trying to describe
46:01
the elephant it's a wall it's a tree
46:04
trunk it's a rope
46:06
each of these are correct and they are
46:08
in complete each silo is only a part of
46:11
the picture of who we are our memories
46:14
fade the fish become bigger the
46:18
intensity of the moment of lessons the
46:21
wounds heal over and we tell our tales
46:24
from a position of an observer instead
46:27
of a participant from the narrator
46:29
instead of the hearing hero of our own
46:32
story when we own our own data we can
46:35
understand the contractions and
46:37
expansions of our own lives we see the
46:40
data that we want to track and we tried
46:42
it not because some corporate entity
46:44
wants to sell us something we don't need
46:46
but rather because it is important to us
46:48
the data delights us we see patterns
46:51
about ourselves and we expand when we
46:55
own our own data we can look back at who
46:57
we thought we were we can see who we
46:59
really learn who we are and most
47:03
importantly we can see the trends
47:04
towards who we wanted to become with our
47:07
own data we can curate and we can shed
47:10
who we didn't want to be to become who
47:14
we want to be and we can write to the
47:16
end of our own story for this is the
47:18
true power of owning our own data to
47:21
understand the cycles of contractions
47:23
and expansions to understand our own
47:25
hero's journey and to write our own
47:27
story I along with hundreds if not
47:32
thousands of
47:34
and grateful for all of you who built
47:37
who scratch your own technology itches
47:40
itches who share with your efforts and
47:42
successes and help the rest of us along
47:45
the way with you up next we have a
48:16
keynote swap we originally scheduled
48:19
Aaron to talk about the leading edge or
48:22
cutting edge in new web
48:23
however we an amazing story about
48:28
changing your identity online that we
48:32
decided was worth sharing with all of
48:34
you so please welcome Michelle Jordan
48:39
I'm changing my domain I'm Jordan or
48:52
Michelle depends on which year you met
48:56
me
48:57
I'd been Michelle since you know I was
49:01
born that's the name my parents gave me
49:02
it's worked pretty well but a couple
49:06
years ago searching for a job forever
49:09
and ever and ever and getting nothing no
49:14
interviews barely getting email
49:16
responses basically I was completely
49:18
ignored in a minor fit of rage overnight
49:25
I copied my website changed every
49:28
reference to Michelle to use my middle
49:31
name Jordan and put it up at a different
49:34
domain took my resume stripped out
49:38
everything that made it pretty because
49:41
if it's pretty it's probably a girl and
49:44
removed all of my leadership and
49:47
volunteer
49:48
it's with organizations like women who
49:49
code started sending out that resume and
49:53
within two weeks I had four interviews I
49:58
ended up speaking at a local meetup and
50:01
somebody heard me and thought I was kind
50:04
of cool and offered me an interview
50:06
which led to a job and I kind of forgot
50:08
about the whole Jordan thing that was
50:10
just some angry weekend experience and
50:14
you know whatever I was working at this
50:17
other job things were going good
50:19
I'd been there about a year and my
50:21
contract was about to expire and that
50:24
meant it was time to start looking for a
50:25
job I was working at Nike and there was
50:28
a hiring freeze on my department so my
50:31
manager wanted to convert me but the
50:34
higher-ups said no everybody can be
50:36
converted right now so I started my job
50:38
hunt again and was not getting any
50:42
traction again so I decided that you
50:46
know maybe it was time to bring Darden
50:48
back but I was kind of running into
50:52
trouble because I now was trying to
50:55
maintain two different online personas
50:58
and neither one felt like me I had
51:02
Michele which is where I posted all my
51:05
cool stuff all the fun things I was
51:06
doing things that were interesting to me
51:08
where my passions were and then Jordan
51:11
who was this kind of mysterious person
51:15
because I didn't really want to say
51:17
anything about Jordan because then he
51:19
might find out that Jordans a girl how
51:21
terrible and they were they were both
51:25
split and they were both just neither
51:28
one was actually me so I ended up having
51:31
to kind of go all in and change all the
51:35
things even having the two different
51:39
things it was getting confusing because
51:41
like I didn't really want to maintain
51:44
two linkedin's one is bad enough
51:49
but people were getting confused because
51:50
they go to you know my Jordan website
51:53
where I said hi my name is Jordan and
51:55
here's my resume where I said I'm Jordan
51:57
and then they go to my LinkedIn and it's
51:59
Michelle so they're like you don't know
52:01
what you're doing you can't even link to
52:03
the right like social pages I'm not
52:06
hiring you for building websites so I
52:09
ended up really having to do all in and
52:11
change my identity absolutely everywhere
52:14
I created new domain name I had to
52:19
change my Twitter got a new Twitter new
52:22
github new Instagram all the things just
52:26
to get a job and pet is such it
52:40
just sucks like and changing my name to
52:46
Jordan kind of felt like giving in to
52:47
the system for a while it was like okay
52:50
so I can't be me so I have to be a fake
52:52
person but maybe it's not so bad like
53:01
it's hard to change things it's hard to
53:03
make the community better if you can't
53:05
become a part of the community the
53:07
community won't let you in there's
53:09
nothing you can do so if what I have to
53:12
do is be Jordan for a little bit to get
53:15
on the inside and make some changes I
53:17
guess that's what I'm gonna do
53:30
[Applause]
53:55
Thank You Jordan all right next up we
54:05
have Marnie McGuire who's going to talk
54:12
about owning your mobile experience
54:14
which used to be a cutting-edge thing
54:17
and now it just works I'm going to
54:31
immediately undercut that by saying
54:34
first thank you all for giving me the
54:37
opportunity to speak up here with all
54:39
these other great keynotes
54:41
thanks for taking a chance on this and
54:43
thanks in advance for going on a journey
54:46
that's probably gonna be a little bit
54:48
weird and intimate like you're coming
54:51
into how I use the Internet
54:53
and I do that as much as I can through
54:56
building blocks that the indie web
54:58
community has made that in my I guess
55:01
three or four years of digging into
55:03
indie web trying to understand it trying
55:06
to build tools and things for myself
55:07
that I've been able to sort of cobble
55:09
together and I think it's some sense
55:12
tantek is right these tools exist and
55:15
once you've kind of plugged to the right
55:17
things together it works but in in
55:21
another sense this is a very organic
55:23
thing that I have slowly accrued over
55:26
time and it has sharp edges it has
55:30
bruises it has bleeding edges Erin how
55:33
are we looking for the okay good
55:36
I can't see it oh I'm plugged in I think
55:44
I was mostly just vamping until the
55:47
screen work trying again
56:11
okay welcome welcome to my phone oh gosh
56:15
alright I would like to start things off
56:17
with some posting so this is an app
56:22
called indigenous it's built by Eddie
56:24
Hinkle and like most of the things I use
56:27
this is someone else's work so Eddie I
56:29
hope I'm not doing you wrong by by
56:32
showcasing this year and how I happen to
56:34
have learned to use it I'm going to
56:36
start with a photo post
56:37
I want to thank Jackie for posing with
56:40
me for this earlier let's we'll get that
56:54
sent off and what this is doing in the
56:57
background is doing two uploads one it's
57:00
sending that photo off to a little
57:02
service that I've built that stores
57:05
media for me and just serves it back and
57:08
and the other is actually making a post
57:10
to my website so we're gonna let that
57:12
post it takes about a minute and
57:14
meanwhile I'm going to show you the
57:15
other I think more interesting parts of
57:18
indigenous indigenous is what we're
57:20
calling an indie reader so blowing it up
57:25
over there in in the day is like a lot
57:29
of folks myself included like to say we
57:32
miss Google Reader there was the days
57:33
when RSS feeds were everywhere you could
57:35
follow all the things that you cared
57:37
about and nothing else to seeing it all
57:39
in a reverse chronological timeline or
57:41
however your app worked for you and one
57:44
of the things that was missing from that
57:45
experience is the actual social aspects
57:49
being able to do something with that so
57:50
this is how indigenous shows some of my
57:54
feeds I have a group called the indie
57:56
web that are basically just people that
57:57
I have learned of through events like
57:59
this I think I like Jackie's post here
58:03
and these are being pulled from the
58:08
feeds on on people sites and I really
58:11
thought there would be a photo there
58:11
it's cool to apologize I don't know why
58:15
I called you out
58:18
and this this is a nice mobile
58:21
experience this is an app that's its
58:22
native I you know I still like this post
58:25
so we can pull this up you can see at
58:27
the bottom of the screen we have some
58:29
options these are these all will
58:30
actually create new posts on my site
58:33
there's I will call Eddie out for this a
58:36
little bit if you click the button
58:37
there's a very little feedback that
58:39
anything happened in theory alike is
58:41
being made on my site now and will show
58:43
up for Jackie later let's see I skipped
58:48
a step here so posting a photo one thing
58:52
we talked about in the indie web a lot
58:53
is what we call Posse like you post up
58:56
on your site but most people don't read
58:57
your site so I want to take that photo
59:00
that I just posted and also put it on
59:04
Twitter so we get some reach so we're
59:08
gonna make a photo post think ice it's
59:10
so excited for an indie web summit day
59:15
and this this is one of the kind of like
59:18
uglier parts of my personal site flow
59:19
where other folks have automated this I
59:23
haven't so I posted my site I posted to
59:26
Twitter and if I want to experience some
59:31
of the cooler parts of the indie web
59:33
where things on this is gonna be very
59:41
awkward cool here's what I can do I can
59:46
we can go to some precooked precooked
59:50
example posts one of the the most
59:55
important things you can do is post
59:57
places where your community still is so
60:00
if that happens to be Twitter you know
60:04
also post things to Twitter and through
60:08
tools like bridgie which Suntech
60:10
mentioned you can have responses come
60:12
back so here's an example of a post that
60:15
I put on my own site and if I click
60:18
through the see also link you can see
60:20
it's also got a tweet a lot of folks
60:24
have asked questions on Twitter
60:25
retweeted it and replied and because I
60:29
have set up my site with bridgie
60:31
I actually get those back so we can see
60:34
like a lot of these are Twitter likes
60:37
reposts and then the actual questions
60:39
themselves comunist mentions and if my
60:43
website was working right now we would
60:45
be doing a live version of this demo
60:46
trust me it sometimes works alright
60:50
let's check my notes here right the this
61:01
reader is great for following India web
61:02
folks but I also use it for a lot of
61:05
other stuff so I don't use Instagram but
61:08
I have an Instagram I have a lot of
61:10
friends that I follow on there and
61:11
through another tool built by Ryan
61:14
Barrett called granary I'm able to
61:16
actually take my Instagram feeds pull
61:19
them in through my reader and and check
61:21
them out here and if there's something
61:23
that I like I can like it on my site if
61:25
there's something I want to reply to I
61:28
can do that on my site and if I want to
61:31
do that my Instagram as well okay let's
61:34
see the pirate friends in Baltimore and
61:38
I can look at all this stuff
61:40
without having to load up Instagram
61:42
without having to have Facebook cookies
61:44
tracking me around and it feels like a
61:48
little step more free and you know it
61:53
takes some effort but I think it's worth
61:55
it okay these things but I can get into
62:05
some of the other weirder stuff
62:07
one thing that is still very
62:09
bleeding-edge is more exotic ways of
62:15
posting and there are wonderful tools
62:18
like you'll see we'll look at monocle
62:21
here this is actually another piece of
62:23
Aaron's work it's a an Indy reader that
62:27
runs in the browser so I can use this
62:28
instead of or in addition to a native
62:31
app and it also has
62:38
I do like this very much
62:44
that one gets a like see maybe these
62:48
will show up someday it's really it's
62:54
really tough when we break your website
62:56
while you're trying to do a live demo
63:05
right I did myself a good thing here so
63:10
one thing I want to do I was on
63:11
Goodreads and I wanted to stop so I I
63:15
built a thing to post reads
63:18
on my site and a lot of this was
63:20
inspired by Gregor who built Indy book
63:23
club biz but I thought it would be even
63:26
faster if I could basically like post
63:28
something I wanted to read from my phone
63:30
and this is where the work of Sebastian
63:34
and egg and rosemary orchard really came
63:37
in handy if any of you have an iOS
63:38
device especially once iOS 13 comes out
63:42
you're gonna want to play with shortcuts
63:43
because this is where indie web building
63:46
blocks actually come into your hands and
63:49
to some extent it's difficult you kind
63:51
of have to be the indie web building
63:53
block in order to move things around but
63:56
through some of their work I was able to
63:59
create shortcuts that can use the same
64:01
indie web building blocks micro pub to
64:03
actually post my site and what I'm doing
64:06
here is I have shared a Goodreads URL to
64:09
my shortcut which is gonna post here
64:12
it's asking me whether I want to mark
64:14
this as something I want to read I'm a
64:15
reading or finished reading I want to
64:17
say it's to read and then it's going to
64:20
create a little micro pub post and I
64:22
often went to my site and the next time
64:24
I get my site compiling it'll be up
64:27
there and we can see we can see like
64:41
these are things that I used to post a
64:45
Goodreads but now I can track them all
64:46
on my site and in theory other folks on
64:49
the indie web can you know look Club it
64:52
up let's see what other folks are
64:53
reading try to read things together one
64:57
last thing I will show before I hop out
64:59
of here that photo that Jackie and I
65:04
took is is a live photo and this is
65:08
where you get into the kind of stuff
65:09
that you can only build when it's it's
65:12
your website like this this kind of
65:15
thing is like new and high on boomerang
65:18
and apps that like you send to people
65:20
and it disappears but I really like this
65:22
little bouncy loop so I'm gonna share it
65:27
to my website and I do that through
65:29
another shortcut I made called live
65:31
photo to micro pub video it takes that
65:33
loop lets you and this is all part of
65:37
iOS so far uploads it put a caption I
65:44
call this the indie web dance
65:46
that's official now and it will post
65:51
that to my site and I do have I have a
65:54
pre-baked make that same thing yes do
66:06
this one
66:10
alright so to wrap this up and not take
66:14
too much time
66:29
go to my pre-baked demo this this is an
66:37
example of what these look like on my
66:38
site so they they're their little
66:42
looping videos that play silently they
66:44
animate for like one second and this is
66:46
the kind of thing that's pretty pretty
66:48
hard to put out and I find there's a lot
66:52
of creativity where if you're willing to
66:54
dig in and get your hands dirty and
66:55
understand these building blocks which
66:58
get easier month by month and year by
67:00
year you can start to like really own
67:03
your own experience and there are things
67:05
I can do now with my phone on my website
67:08
with the social web that I never would
67:10
have imagined a few years ago and if I
67:12
lost this play out be really sad so
67:16
we'll leave it there thanks very much so
67:32
you got some real world indie web
67:34
experience there I think that was the
67:37
first indie web presentation that was a
67:39
hundred percent done on the mobile
67:40
device so thank you Marty for taking
67:43
that brave bold step with your personal
67:45
site well lots of stuff did work and
67:51
that really goes to another one of the
67:54
big challenges is like basically in the
67:56
last what since 2007 10 years plus
68:00
everyone's switching smart phones and
68:01
smart devices and doing everything with
68:03
smart phones so the more that we're able
68:05
to conveniently just make work our
68:07
mobile devices with our own websites the
68:09
more we'll use them the more we'll use
68:12
them instead all the surveillance
68:15
capitalism that's out there so for our
68:19
final keynote I'd like to welcome up
68:21
Jackie who's going to talk about making
68:25
the indie web for all
68:28
[Applause]
68:53
you know it's a good day if you came
68:54
member you left our password
69:07
okay all right
69:10
make this purely organic and go straight
69:14
this slides I would say like oh you can
69:18
go to this URL but the bar is so small
69:20
so mother entertained idea oh all right
69:28
cool so talked I knows a little bit to
69:34
all this is something I've kind of toyed
69:38
around a little bit personally and also
69:39
it's like one of the courts and it's
69:40
special and bringing the things that we
69:44
use every day or at least I know like
69:45
most you all seen online when I use
69:47
every day and bring it to other people
69:50
so a little bit about me I'm a guy who
69:53
lives in someplace people called North
69:55
Kyle and I like working on things for
69:57
people to help people live lives of
69:59
other people website there's three
70:03
things that I want to kind of touch on
70:05
today and it took me a long time to kind
70:06
of get these words together because they
70:07
have to be catchy even walk around show
70:09
to people
70:10
the first idea it was around inspiration
70:12
how do we take the things that make us
70:14
passionate people like kind of passing
70:18
the torch as shown before of Marty
70:21
there's things that we do that we find
70:23
that's enjoying that's liberating and
70:25
also things we could share about this
70:26
like quirky fun and exciting what the
70:29
level of Speicher's that we get from
70:30
these things there's a way to kind of
70:32
encourage me but scum do the same to do
70:38
the same with our sites not the stories
70:40
just to keep it there a little bit but
70:42
to put a doorstop so we don't burn
70:43
ourselves out trying to bring every
70:45
person with those two things we can
70:47
start reflecting and investigating on
70:48
the things that we know that are
70:51
difficult and reduce the barrier to
70:53
entry thus making that doorstop
70:54
something be just copy and paste and put
70:56
in other places starting up inspiration
71:03
she can't see my notes that's fine yeah
71:08
aspiration tends to be a thing that it's
71:10
organic it's something that we coming to
71:12
we enjoy and expand on I guess like one
71:16
thing on my personal side I used to buy
71:19
most that excite all at the back it was
71:20
something I enjoyed doing it also gave
71:21
me a chance to kind of tinker and mold
71:23
like my site was clay I could take it
71:24
molded crafted mostly time according to
71:27
share of other people when it came to
71:30
things the Edit of my site I saw the
71:31
people doing more in-depth things like
71:33
there's people who can capture it you
71:35
know where they've traveled to or they
71:37
travel to things that they presumed in
71:38
like I mean if it could be recorded it
71:41
can kind of be captured and those kind
71:43
of things led to prove that no is this
71:44
something that can be done all the time
71:46
but something that could be done very
71:47
simply and definitely in this age we're
71:50
more of a kind of people like if it's a
71:52
low low effort and like a high battery
71:55
kind of thing we're gonna just jump into
71:56
it every single time so there's a few
72:01
ideas and things that I will try to
72:03
propose today and hopefully you can like
72:05
lead other conversations that we can
72:06
have in our breakout sessions today one
72:08
thing that's always worked out or I
72:09
should say always but it has a high
72:11
success rate is kind of giving people a
72:13
chance to manipulate data and see how
72:15
its presented a real time I'm gonna
72:17
start with the one of the most infamous
72:19
capers in history Bonnie and Clyde so
72:22
let's say Bonnie and Clyde were on the
72:23
same social media network and they
72:24
happened to be across the country
72:26
Clyde sees a post about body you know
72:28
bring in to like Ches jewelers and
72:31
getting this nice piece we can
72:34
manipulate and kind of show how the
72:36
blocks of what we do here can kind of
72:38
tie in to the fix this is a way it kind
72:41
of like demonstrating a post that Clyde
72:43
would make his own site provided his
72:46
website each part kind of proving a
72:49
client goes into there
72:51
tying in to how one person's identity on
72:56
their own site because it could be
72:57
something that you post off him other
72:58
place to go from there each step is
73:00
something that could demonstrate it up
73:01
and down here one thing this is actually
73:05
something I'm trying to work on but I'm
73:07
pretty sure somebody has a better idea
73:08
into it is how do we show how content
73:10
kind of spreads around in some platforms
73:12
you can see like you know Clark like
73:14
Louis's post when he was going on over
73:16
or trying to find more local references
73:19
other certain places it could be one
73:21
person starts their site and they invite
73:23
like you know to other people they start
73:25
talking with one another and a person's
73:27
outside of network then pulls another
73:28
friend in they start communicating and
73:31
so on so forth the thing is right now
73:33
for you to do this so it's kind of click
73:35
the post and go through the way if there
73:37
is a way to easily demonstrate how these
73:39
things are shared it would kind of
73:40
encourage people like my content can
73:41
actually travel I don't worry about
73:43
being chucked in my site but this other
73:44
places can go too so yeah visualizing
73:48
how interactions kind of spread across
73:49
the web through yes this is gonna be a
73:54
fun one so you might see yourself on
73:55
here kind of also demonstrating how we
73:57
preserve our own content our own sites
73:59
one thing we have the amazing luxury of
74:02
it is it's not being stuck into cutting
74:04
cookie cutter presentations like we're
74:06
not like some little random blue text on
74:08
the web site or one no we can
74:10
demonstrate things exactly happy I can
74:11
show you how people tend to reply to my
74:13
site or how someone else may when you
74:16
check in a place or short notes that
74:17
people in other sites so and so forth
74:21
and it can be also you okay each person
74:23
is not constrainted by whatever platform
74:26
they have because the platforms on your
74:27
own definition which kind of ties is
74:30
something about their jump in order to
74:34
not only let people end but to make them
74:37
feel like they can just stay in a space
74:38
when they work on things we have to kind
74:40
of put tape on the floor like this is
74:42
the easiest way to go this way but from
74:43
here you can go through other things
74:46
one thing I've tried to personally point
74:47
on obviously what they get out to other
74:49
sites isn't sure that it's always
74:51
explained like if you want to kind of
74:52
talk back this is way so you can lead it
74:54
to I'm leading to other venues for
74:56
unarmed side entities it has to be
74:58
faster they jump to that and making it
75:00
easier for people to cut out get into
75:02
places which is tying into invitations
75:06
this is something I know as somebody who
75:09
runs or who used to rather run like
75:11
monthly there's inviting people to a
75:12
place just one place is always kind of
75:14
difficult and trying to make it tough in
75:19
that's easy to automate easy to copy he
75:21
was he's running it's always gonna be
75:22
kind of hard typically if somebody tells
75:25
you like oh I can't make it today
75:26
or if like when it comes like Home Rule
75:28
camps or if there's like I can't
75:30
obviously pizza site because of X Y and
75:33
Q it's usually because of something that
75:35
either we haven't fully provided to them
75:37
yet or some kind of barrier that they
75:38
run into and they were expected for my
75:39
experience so it's like how do we we
75:41
reach halfway but are we on the same
75:43
kind of road like are we going on or
75:45
weekly to get convicted paps this ties
75:47
into aspect but this is so anyone has a
75:50
list of 12 okay and this is one that
75:57
I've always kind of bent over and over
75:58
whenever I just tried to do things I do
76:01
it for me but also for like the most
76:02
immediate people to my circle and I'm
76:04
working and building those two things
76:05
together are always kind of difficult
76:07
kind of juggling right
76:09
I'm kind of juggling how I can make
76:11
something I can share with somebody but
76:13
also pull into other people it's
76:15
something I grew up I'm the oldest of
76:16
five so whatever I think of sometimes
76:17
alright how can I make sure me and
76:19
Christopher and my siblings like all
76:21
convert together to get this playing all
76:22
the time it's usually something I think
76:25
that I had to focus on myself but it's
76:27
not only me it's how we get these things
76:31
the easiest way to go about this is
76:33
because we all obviously hear you know
76:35
advocating for a particular group of
76:37
people to help share these ideas and
76:39
notions there is more anthem and throw
76:43
from logic English is my first and like
76:46
no tech approaches to get things done
76:48
and it can be as simple as like writing
76:50
documentation that helps people
76:52
understand like you know what
76:53
microformats alright
76:54
or even given that word I want to say I
76:57
Jason tools and like templates and
76:59
things I put the things that we need
77:05
which kind of now ties into
77:07
understanding where people are we can
77:08
then start working on the kind of things
77:10
that they run into
77:15
so things that tend to trip people up
77:17
this is actually something I've run into
77:19
personally every time I have to spit
77:20
some search history there's something
77:21
called micro data we don't necessary use
77:23
that you can if you want
77:24
um it won't necessarily say it's here
77:27
this is one thing that has also come up
77:30
people feel like there's no something
77:31
nothing that they could just pick up a
77:32
work with there are solutions out there
77:34
it's just not what they're looking for
77:37
which is not kind of like a chicken in
77:39
that situation like we don't know what
77:40
we can provide you if you don't tell us
77:41
what we have these things here you yeah
77:43
it's kind of trying out so we could
77:44
figure out some time little girl there
77:46
is always this notion and it's
77:48
well-founded that they knew what was the
77:50
filter for people who like looking at 80
77:53
by 24 console screens which is not
77:54
inside make sure there's a lot of people
77:57
out there who do article do music who
77:58
will put on contest on a platform like
78:00
micro blog yes
78:04
oh so showstopper and I you so stop your
78:07
hearing coats of causation it's to
78:08
highlight how these are things that if
78:10
they can't find a mini I'm like the
78:12
homepage or two days they're just like
78:13
well this is not something I can use
78:15
like they don't have because I work for
78:16
them um audience control is a very
78:18
obscure way of saying I want to like
78:20
hack content of web that's like you you
78:24
it's a very active topic that we have
78:27
any web right now in terms of kind of
78:28
private clothes and it's something that
78:30
there's no real one size fits all kinds
78:33
or situations like what might work for
78:35
me like you know password-protected post
78:37
me not working somebody else because I
78:38
share this pastures and firmer why then
78:46
it is basically kind of being happy
78:47
having the ability to kind of dispose
78:49
information or just how you present
78:51
yourself in the world given that we are
78:54
associated with DNS with the main name
78:56
it's kind of hard to just kind of
78:57
disappear per se because we're always
78:59
kind of currently archive everything
79:07
there was a middle slide about how kind
79:10
of things can be compromised and that we
79:12
kind of have to look it's like a bento
79:14
box kind of solution for things but not
79:16
also not necessarily to give everybody
79:18
what they need because we have to kind
79:19
of courage that this blocks that people
79:21
could name used to build themselves but
79:22
we'll put enough through tallies get to
79:24
the door that ties into the idea of
79:27
having
79:27
not tightly coupled solutions but things
79:31
like an you can just click click click
79:33
and kind of get going so you can RSVP to
79:35
events like this or maybe even just like
79:37
post with a sigh and kind of keep
79:38
looking there but this is these
79:41
extensions can kind of encourage you
79:42
want to start building that websites the
79:44
thing that and it's like kind of
79:46
champions that we don't want to kind of
79:48
control how you do your stuff because in
79:49
that way we're no better than like you
79:51
know Facebook or Twitter gets platforms
79:52
they start to control how you interact
79:54
with the sites ok so this is the this is
80:03
the part where we had to understand and
80:06
we have actually a good understanding
80:07
the wiki kind of documents things that
80:09
we noticed that people tend to get
80:10
tripped on and where we go we had to
80:12
understand where we can kind of like
80:14
encourage people to kind of keep pulling
80:16
things in but also how can we kind of
80:18
get out there say like it's not as hard
80:19
as what's five years ago it's gotten a
80:21
lot better it's a lot easier in this
80:23
ways you can get things done
80:24
so it's what we can do to pull people in
80:28
it's got to be hard it's not gonna be
80:30
easy most good things don't come easily
80:31
they always come with a little strife a
80:33
little struggle so that's where the
80:38
principle of the third principle rafts
80:39
were like building for us we have to
80:40
build for us but also for the person
80:41
that the kind of cedar room like how can
80:43
we ensure that whoever comes on next
80:46
after us can easily get something though
80:47
which then inspires them to invite other
80:49
people and pull other things as a
80:51
platform it's we have a lot of it just
80:54
like my wiki page there's like 14
80:56
specific things and I'm trying to send
80:57
post for my site to write to my
80:59
newsletter so I can like it do it one
81:00
place versus 70 we have to I'm at a
81:04
voice saying we or rather have to like
81:06
we shouldn't encourage more people to
81:08
take five things off their list and just
81:10
hammer out it just keep going it cuz
81:11
increase like a record of how we go
81:15
about things how people can just think
81:16
of something and kind of make it happen
81:18
and this is something I shall go to
81:20
myself but we also kind of have to hear
81:22
what people are kind of saying is the
81:23
hardest things like people will say
81:25
anything but once we hear things I kind
81:27
of surface at the top like I can't see
81:29
posts I can't write to you so I kind of
81:32
hats like hold on those ideas and see
81:34
where we can go over there
81:39
[Applause]
81:57
once again everyone check the Allison
81:59
somebody that way okay and thank you to
82:07
our keynote speakers being so timely
82:11
we were only right I'm just behind now
82:13
well done okay we are now entering the
82:17
introductions and personal site demos
82:19
section of our schedule which means
82:22
anyone that wants to give a personal
82:24
site demo like two minutes or less is
82:25
welcome to do so and I'm going to
82:27
demonstrate like just how minimal that
82:29
can be let's see okay my site if you
82:34
wanted to demonstrate why don't we get a
82:36
few people lined up over on this bench
82:38
here where the Sun says four geysers of
82:40
speakers only and obviously if you're
82:43
lining up there you're gonna come up
82:44
here and speak so yeah so Marty's
82:51
counting all the time which you should
82:52
already started for me because this
82:54
whole thing let's do it under 22 minutes
82:57
this is my website taunting calm I post
83:01
things here like RSVPs notes photos etc
83:04
and the most recent thing that I built
83:07
on my website was a theme switcher where
83:10
I can switch it to this matrix like
83:13
theme that I did back in March for the
83:17
20th anniversary of the matrix or I
83:19
decided well if I'm gonna make one theme
83:22
I should use CSS variables and make
83:23
multiple themes and so I made a Tron
83:26
Legacy colors themed theme as well and
83:29
it's pretty minimal it just uses like a
83:32
query parameter and it even works in the
83:34
permalinks and stays that way until you
83:37
somehow find that magic
83:39
take me home button on the home page
83:41
that's it
83:46
alright who's next
83:48
come on up if you're sitting there means
83:51
you're coming up in demoing so of course
84:09
so what I wanted to demo oh yeah Oh JB
84:13
sharp ok ok what I want to demo is this
84:33
RSS feed reader I'm working on that is
84:35
designed for use with things like web
84:39
comics and serial stories which I'm
84:42
going to claim is a needs a different
84:46
perspective than the way a lot of RSS
84:49
feed readers have been built so I have
84:51
here
84:52
Fluffy's going to be coming up shortly I
84:56
have here one of one of their comics and
85:03
what I want to emphasize about this is
85:05
the the focus on
86:36
[Music]
86:46
being able to have quotes and different
86:49
things I'm moving away from YouTube and
86:54
using Vimeo sorta posting thing that
86:57
releases it allowed me at video
86:58
surveillance tonight so I haven't gotten
87:01
all of like sort of past videos reposted
87:04
on Vimeo and the simple on the video
87:06
page but I'll be still here even though
87:09
Vimeo sort of is its own silo and some
87:12
social networking issue sort of thing
87:15
going on because as you create pay for
87:17
it anything that video ads on your
87:20
website I feel like it's pretty decent
87:21
if you're looking to do a lot of video
87:26
following with a newsletter and and just
87:31
real quick 17 seconds left
87:33
even though use MailChimp I create my
87:35
own one you know newsletter issues
87:41
[Music]
87:42
[Applause]
87:57
don't touch this thing's back we call it
88:17
squared okay guys I plugged in the HDMI
88:22
is it is that good enough or maybe it
88:24
needs to be the Thunder here hold on oh
88:38

88:50
well done we have a lot of catching up
88:52
to do but we are expanding or contract
88:56
that was awesome you know honestly I
89:01
didn't really need visuals if it's not
89:03
in the cards I'm Griffin and that guy
89:06
I'm sorry I apologize I think this is
89:09
this is a really nice thank you
89:12
this actually is works oh it's just this
89:16
works perfectly to demonstrate its like
89:18
I have two surgeons working on me as I
89:20
talk to me very handsome
89:23
okay it's way to demonstrate perfectly
89:27
that I'm in that less technical crowd
89:30
and if my website happens to show up
89:34
yeah it's not that I really want to
89:37
demonstrate the website all right just
89:40
oh here we go we got mouse power it's
89:42
not that I don't want to demonstrate the
89:43
website I just want to offer a little
89:45
history that hopefully provides insight
89:49
into
89:50
I think maybe the uphill but probably
89:54
exciting climb to get to I got 13 sites
89:57
I got 12 seconds what's that I had 10
90:01
seconds of of what it takes when you're
90:03
non techie to get online like it took me
90:06
so long to finally just give up on HTML
90:08
and go with Squarespace and that has
90:11
been my talk thank you so here's my
90:35
website displays this is the brand new
90:51
key cron T 10 which doesn't work as well
90:53
as I thought okay
91:06
there we go okay so here's my website
91:09
it's peas bust up is I make a lot of
91:11
different kinds of content yeah and so
91:15
it was there weren't any real CMS's that
91:18
could handle my various very
91:21
heterogeneous content types
91:22
so I built my own called public so it's
91:25
very template based I've got you a blog
91:27
which I use for long-form stuff I've got
91:29
an art gallery
91:31
I made comics which jackie showed
91:35
earlier and so I've also got it's got
91:38
like this nested I've got a nested like
91:47
a nested archive so I have like multiple
91:49
archives that run in parallel I did not
91:51
really plan this very well so here's the
91:54
so these are just like multiple archives
91:57
that are nested together and so with
92:00
bubble it's also it's based on git
92:03
deployments it's like a I bill it as
92:05
like a static site generator only
92:07
dynamic so it's like it's a git workflow
92:10
for I can use a git workflow for doing
92:14
rapid deployment is all containerized
92:16
and everything so if anyone else is
92:19
interested in that sort of content
92:21
management please talk to me
92:28
[Applause]
92:49
yep cool okay
92:52
well that looks terrifying because it
92:53
like got the screen really tiny yeah my
92:56
site now it's I'm Jordan codes which is
92:59
super exciting because I now have the
93:02
same like handle on everything because
93:06
apparently Jordan is a less common name
93:07
than Michelle but I'm super excited
93:11
about all my animations like my swimming
93:13
fish and whenever you reload the page
93:14
the colors change and this thing
93:18
normally is not covering the navigation
93:22
and I have decided that I can be a girl
93:26
on my website because once people get to
93:28
my website they don't care anymore it's
93:30
getting on there that's the problem I'm
93:36
just pretty excited because all of its
93:37
my own drawings and things whoever's
93:51
next you're gonna be standing right here
93:53
you are next right now whoever's next
93:56
after you
94:13
thereíre hi everybody I'm Andy gal Pern
94:18
this is interesting because the bar on
94:21
the bottom is anyway I am I'm the
94:27
founder of Cascade SF which is a user
94:30
experience design organization we're
94:32
based out of San Francisco and basically
94:36
I work with designers and brands and
94:39
companies and I help them
94:41
I studied the design industry and I help
94:45
companies align with designers not as a
94:48
recruiter but more as an educator to
94:50
help make products and software more
94:53
usable and I also do content strategy
94:56
for Adobe as a freelancer on the side
94:59
and so what I wanted to do I was
95:01
actually I'm more like I finally got
95:04
this like simple cute little website
95:07
together and I did it with I created it
95:09
with web flow but I was more curious I'm
95:13
more demonstrating this as a visual
95:15
question which is that as a Content
95:18
strategist I write content for other
95:21
companies and I was wondering can you
95:25
replicate that content this is on a
95:28
cloud of site are we able to even though
95:33
that mic work is owned by another
95:36
company is it okay for us to still own
95:40
our writing and our content and that
95:42
that becomes a question for me as a
95:45
writer so I'm curious of that but also I
95:48
want to set one of the reasons I'm here
95:50
this weekend is I've been part of the
95:52
indie web camp for like eight years or
95:55
so for a while and I would like to
95:58
develop a blog and create more content
96:02
on my own personal site so that's a see
96:05
y'all later
96:07
[Applause]
96:14
USBC okay this is my nightmare okay yes
96:32
and hi I'm William Care bake my domain
96:35
is anomaly net and this will not be new
96:41
okay is it coming I'm plugging in the
96:48
USB see the other way even though it
96:49
supposed to be how many web developers
96:55
does it take to get a V working really
97:00
does it not does it hate us it does hate
97:05
us let's use your computer for this
97:12
clearly we should have done all mobile
97:14
presentations like yours okay so for
97:19
people that have seen my website before
97:20
a previous indie web summits this will
97:22
not be new what okay there we go yeah
97:26
alright so this is my website which I am
97:30
kind of at the point where I have doing
97:33
that opposite of what a lot of people
97:34
are doing which is that I'm splitting my
97:36
dynamic content away from kind of my
97:39
more static content so this is my
97:41
internet landing page and where all my
97:43
blog stuff goes but I also have anomaly
97:46
dot world which was originally set up
97:48
for a long distance trip that I did but
97:52
all of my Instagram and check-in posts
97:55
go here so I am revamping this to
97:59
essentially be my Foursquare check-ins
98:01
and Instagram dynamic posts and I would
98:05
click on check-ins come on come on
98:10
Internet my website so so currently the
98:16
only dynamic content that I have on a
98:17
regular basis on my own website is
98:20
WordPress there well you can see my
98:23
check-ins oh there's my okay no I'm just
98:44
showing some boxes some years back I
98:47
don't remember how many years back at
98:49
indiewebcamp we were talking about
98:51
little boxes and somebody's actually
98:52
said we should have an indie box okay
98:55
well it now exists you can buy it
98:59
basically apart ties the whole thing
99:02
currently it only runs next cloud which
99:04
is basically an open-source
99:05
implementation of Google Docs
99:06
calendaring file sharing its affordances
99:10
worth there's at least one customer in
99:12
the audience and it exists and I would
99:15
like to bring a lot of indie web stuff
99:17
here as well there's some practical
99:18
difficulties and all sorts of things in
99:20
putting a bit my the firewall but I just
99:22
want to tell you that it exists this is
99:23
based on the Intel nook and this one is
99:25
based on the Raspberry Pi yeah we're
99:34
we're gonna cross our fingers
100:01
hi my name is Jonathan lock or clever
100:05
devil I Oh clever devil on all the
100:06
things this is my site it's built
100:10
unknown which is a open source CMS I
100:13
wanted to show a couple different things
100:15
that I added recently so one of the
100:18
coolest things I had recently is these
100:20
summary pages so you can actually click
100:22
on one of these and see what happened in
100:24
April of 2019 and you can see that I had
100:27
a little bit for you I posted 188 times
100:31
including the 42 records of what I
100:33
watched on
100:34
movies TV and stuff 39 video games I
100:36
played that's automatically posted for
100:39
my Nintendo switch using very dirty
100:42
hacks it's pretty fun and all sorts of
100:47
good stuff in here all the check ins of
100:48
different places I had been in that
100:51
month here's all the things that I
100:53
watched all the video games that I
100:54
played and podcasts that listen to my
100:57
microblog so this is a cool new thing
100:59
that I did but one of the things that I
101:00
wanted to impress upon everyone if this
101:03
is your first indie web kind of event
101:05
for me the most important thing about my
101:09
site and hopefully all about your sites
101:11
eventually is memories and how important
101:16
they can be in our lives so I want to
101:18
show you real quickly if I click on my
101:20
archive page here
101:21
you can see that I have this little kind
101:24
of interface which shows all the days
101:26
and in each year which I have content
101:28
and if I scroll down I've had a bunch of
101:31
different personal websites over the
101:32
years I went through a process of
101:33
getting old my content from all of those
101:36
places all of my stuff from Facebook
101:38
Twitter Instagram and my legacy domains
101:41
and now it's all they're back to 2002
101:43
this year I lost my dog who's it was 16
101:47
he was very special to me I he actually
101:51
I put the engagement ring around his
101:52
neck when I proposed to my wife and he
101:55
was very important but the cool thing is
101:57
I can go search for his name Winston on
101:59
my site and you can see that we took
102:02
family pictures with him before we had
102:03
to say goodbye and he was resting on
102:06
that but if you go all the way back to
102:10
the very first page you can see on
102:13
December 24 2002 when I gave my not yet
102:18
wife my longtime girlfriend a puppy and
102:22
so memories are important on your
102:24
identity hold on to that this is not
102:27
encumbered buying silo it's it's mine
102:32
[Applause]
102:51
all right that is a small hold on
102:57
resolution thank you there we go
103:07
all right so hi everybody my name is
103:10
Micah Silverman I'm a total newb here
103:12
and great to meet you all I have the
103:16
distinct pleasure although I don't know
103:18
if he characterized it this way working
103:20
with Aaron and I'm a software developer
103:24
and developer evangelist for ferrata and
103:28
what I just wanted to show you quickly
103:30
is is my site here this it's a fit nerd
103:32
calm and it just has some some random
103:37
stuff I haven't been that active with it
103:39
this particular post is me fixing a Dark
103:43
Tower keypad using an Adafruit
103:46
keypad replacement but one of the things
103:51
it does is each time it loads it
103:53
presents either an angel or a devil of
103:55
me which is aligned with my chaotic
103:58
neutral disposition but more importantly
104:01
it is a static site that is currently
104:06
hosted on net liffe I by pointing to my
104:09
github repo and all of the files I have
104:13
I have locally so net liffe I could go
104:16
down github could blow up I could easily
104:18
Rijos this somewhere else it's using
104:20
static site generator called Jekyll
104:23
having to talk to anybody who is
104:25
interested in Jekyll or Hugo and what
104:29
I'm working on is a little API add-on
104:34
for
104:36
four key base and net Liffe I where you
104:40
can keep all your files on a public
104:43
folder on key base and post directly to
104:45
notify thank you are we gonna try the
104:52
line this one will work because I
104:54
plugged in here before Thank You Darius
105:00
I mean it's just my laptop but sure yes
105:04
this should work thank you very much I
105:26
just met there is and he mentioned he
105:28
knew me from my website which is nice
105:31
considering that it's an extremely low
105:35
tech website and I debated whether I was
105:40
going to share this amount when I
105:41
thought well there may be people who
105:42
will benefit from me sharing this
105:45
because I'm a systems engineer applied
105:49
mathematician and musician do all these
105:52
things I don't really have so far I've
105:54
had time to get deep into web design but
105:59
I learned a team a long time ago and
106:01
just bare-bones stuff and but a very few
106:07
sets of commands allowed me to create
106:11
lots of pages and I own several domains
106:14
and can share content music content
106:19
animation and all that kind of stuff I
106:22
mean you know like all kinds of
106:24
different IP and so that was the main
106:29
reason I wanted to share this so all
106:32
these albums including one that is about
106:35
to be released
106:36
and 4th of July and I really appreciated
106:42
kits therapeutic talk especially about
106:46
silos I've had the experience of having
106:49
YouTube and other accounts with tens of
106:53
thousands of views and stuff and my
106:54
account is locked out and they're still
106:56
selling hats so I thought you know that
107:00
just happened over and over again so I
107:01
just learned about indie web last week
107:05
and so this is a pretty amazing
107:09
experience for me to be here and to meet
107:12
the compose that so far anyway but I
107:15
mean point of being here and talk about
107:17
this at the moment to show you the site
107:19
is that I've got a lot of mileage out of
107:22
just HTML I mean just really old-school
107:25
stuff all right
107:33
oh sorry doo doo yeah just stepping on
107:40
my own laptop it's weird I've been
107:42
following
107:43
yeah I've seen Kevin's web site since 99
107:46
I think but this is my web site mostly
107:50
what I want to show is I'm Darius Kazemi
107:53
otherwise known as tiny subversions I
107:57
mostly want to show that I use Google
107:59
sheets is my CMS google.com this is
108:06
Google it's a search engine site 7 119
108:15
that should work there it is my newest
108:19
project is Google the cool thing is it
108:21
means that I can open up Google Google
108:24
Docs on my phone and update my website
108:26
wherever I am so that's mostly why I do
108:28
this anyway that's why I wanted to show
108:31
I can just call you if someone needs to
108:56
I have my own 1080 reader an RSS reader
109:01
like for Google user and our IP Google
109:05
Reader but also it's kind of like a
109:06
tumblr so tumblr our IP as well it has
109:10
like various things like I could do like
109:13
RSVP some kind of natural language kind
109:15
of thing is about that
109:16
do I want to reply to nabeel's post in
109:19
the back there and so I can do a reply
109:21
I'll add that I post it has kind of rich
109:25
content here the next XO video from last
109:28
year paste it in it'll unfurl the link
109:31
and put something which which data in
109:33
there I can go doing a website have a
109:35
bookmarklet here in the reblog because
109:38
we've got a picture no we blogged that
109:40
to my website this is how it looks like
109:42
in the end it's kind of like photos it's
109:44
made like a photo blog I try to make it
109:46
like I'm tumblr ish but has also has
109:47
different things like that I try to pull
109:50
in the piece like like that bridgie and
109:52
like the like pet bridgy and like the
109:56
good Negrin meri codebase I'm trying to
109:58
make look at the JavaScript version of
109:59
that so it's called social butterfly
110:01
basicly tries to pool in activity pile
110:05
up and webfinger
110:05
web mentions and all this stuff and tell
110:07
you one thing that you could reuse it's
110:08
just can med stall and then just kind of
110:10
like we use that library as needed and
110:12
then just like his final Doge to be
110:14
silly before I got into web I was making
110:16
tiny houses and and one of the guys that
110:19
started the tiny offices movements like
110:20
Jay Shafer and one of his things what he
110:23
was starting was like a Napoleon complex
110:26
and one of his they worked at the
110:28
working subtitle here was cohousing for
110:30
the anti-social and so for me that's
110:32
like some some kind of like overlap for
110:33
they do web like I tends to be other
110:36
integrated crowd a little bit but like
110:37
but we do want to be social goes where
110:39
humans and so like there's some kind of
110:40
like you know but we want to be like
110:41
have our own
110:42
and so yeah
110:45
[Applause]
111:13
my mouth stopped working oh no working
111:17
there yeah my name is Tomas camiones a
111:21
longtime IT guy neophyte programmer I
111:24
always wanted use in like web stuff and
111:26
lately after going through free code
111:28
camp I'm trying to get ideas of what I
111:29
really want to do with it also my very
111:32
avid cyclist I do a lot of that
111:34
country's exploration and what I'd like
111:37
to do is take all my spot trekker
111:40
check-ins and tracks as well as my bride
111:42
with GPS recorded tracks and put them on
111:46
a go a personal heat map which I know if
111:50
you can see this very well this only
111:51
represents probably 10% of the writing
111:54
that I've done in the past ten years
111:55
there's a lot more writing that goes
111:57
more towards like south east or again
111:59
that's not showing here yet I couldn't
112:00
get the page to render properly it's
112:01
kind of messed up but what I'd like to
112:04
do is take something I found on github
112:06
implemented on my own personal blog and
112:09
use the ride with GPS API to do like a
112:13
daily pull of any rides that I've done
112:14
and include on that key map the spot
112:19
tracker has a way to share like what
112:22
your daily check-in or regular check-ins
112:23
are or your tracks but it looks like
112:26
there are no longer showing my entire
112:28
history it's only showing my last
112:29
check-in from a few days ago which is
112:31
just at my office but I'd like to also
112:35
like use the spot API to pull my my
112:40
check into tracks and I should store
112:41
them so I have history rather than just
112:43
whatever spot decides to show me at any
112:46
one time I know and all this kind of
112:51
cumulates to my goal of riding the Baja
112:54
divide in December over six weeks
112:58
[Applause]
113:35
hey everyone my name is Cady Johnson I'm
113:38
a product designer and I wanted to show
113:41
you this website that I built with some
113:42
folks in Bellingham where I'm you found
113:45
someone recently that we used to help
113:49
support a community design experiment
113:51
and just helps a kind of coalesce and
113:54
build community around designing and
113:56
technologists in town and we created
113:58
this website to using materialized to
114:01
help make that more accessible make the
114:05
activities of the community more more
114:08
visible to whoever one stay involved and
114:12
one of the big things we did was create
114:15
a peer mentoring program where people
114:17
took a survey and were algorithmic
114:19
algorithmically matched with other
114:22
people who had complementary skills to
114:24
share and then they were matched and we
114:27
did a workshop in person to help
114:30
facilitate goal-setting
114:31
around those those matches so we
114:36
published the methodology for the kind
114:39
of intention for the experiment on the
114:40
website so folks could really see what
114:42
they were getting kind of what the
114:44
thinking was behind it and see if they
114:45
wanted to get involved and participate
114:50
so this was a fun way to kind of design
114:55
something for the community and also
114:59
publish it in a way that was was
115:01
available and we got to buy that
115:03
Bellingham design to me
115:07
I don't know how to share my screen I
115:35
can just I just do this except dragging
115:41
across yes okay so my name is Malcolm my
115:47
website is you know cyclic calm cool all
115:53
right
115:53
so my homepage I can't see it okay so my
116:00
homepage is actually on unicycling comm
116:03
/ what / now okay and something I've
116:09
added to my site recently is I have like
116:12
a whole indie web section on my site I
116:17
can't read this I can see I can see
116:29
better here
116:34
cool okay so this is a new thing I did
116:42
that I guess I can put it out as a
116:46
challenge to people if you can write a
116:48
follow post to this page then this page
116:50
will follow you back so it's a bit
116:54
tricky it looks you up and then tries to
116:56
find a feat to follow it so like there's
116:58
some discovery issues around that so if
117:02
you do try it and you get a web mention
117:05
message back from you might need to a
117:08
couple to follow post is first book once
117:09
you look up what that is tell me what
117:11
sort of reply you get from it oh no
117:13
that's me other time
117:16
[Applause]
117:42
I'm a name's jack Jamison academic and
117:46
I'm interested in values and webs web
117:49
infrastructures so many types my kind of
117:52
thing but what I want to show off my my
117:55
site here is running on WordPress and
117:57
I've been working on a plug-in there's a
118:00
Microsoft server that runs on your
118:02
WordPress site which means you can use
118:04
applications like indigenous or Monaco
118:07
that Marty was showing off on his mobile
118:09
to follow your feeds and all of the you
118:12
know aggregating and pulling together
118:13
feeds just happening right on my server
118:16
and I posted just this morning getting
118:19
started guide and pushed version 1.0 to
118:22
my github so I'm pretty happy about that
118:23
all right here's what it looks like on
118:27
back-end you can see a list of channels
118:29
I can open up a channel and it'll show
118:32
me what feeds I'm following and I can
118:34
add additional feeds and then here's
118:40
what it looks like in Monaco here's some
118:43
posts or in another Microsoft client
118:46
together so I'm pretty stoked about that
118:50
great thank you
118:54
[Applause]
119:16
all right so hi my name is Dave Peck I'm
119:18
an engineer and investor in Seattle and
119:22
this is my personal website I'm both
119:24
excited and nervous to show it to you
119:26
primarily because according to my logs
119:28
they're exactly two people who look at
119:30
it today so you're probably number 43 to
119:33
48 if they're 46 people in the room and
119:35
that's my mom and dad it's a super
119:38
minimalist website because I'm not a
119:40
designer so I keep the focus on text
119:42
primarily but the thing I wanted to show
119:44
is I do a little bit of audio work on
119:46
the side and I wanted to find a way to
119:49
get audio in line with the content so I
119:52
built this little player that I'm pretty
119:55
excited about that is as minimal as the
119:57
rest of the website and I don't think
120:00
any audio it's gonna come out this fine
120:01
you can just press a button and listen
120:03
to tracks I've been working on with
120:05
friends and I kind of geek out on music
120:07
here a little bit let's talk about that
120:08
I heard somebody mentioned static
120:10
website Jekel that's what this is and
120:12
actually one of my technical interest
120:14
right now is how do we stand up a microp
120:17
up end point I'd mention end point etc
120:20
tied to a static back-end so thanks
120:29
[Applause]
120:50
my domain is Maxwell Johnson calm once
120:54
you know that you also know my human
120:56
name very convenient there are things on
121:00
the website things for me things are you
121:05
homes games articles whatever you want
121:11
take a look some time that's all alright
121:34
so this is my site and I read an article
121:36
a while ago a long while ago actually
121:38
that was something long lines of this is
121:41
just a site so it shouldn't be a more
121:43
complicated than what you need it to be
121:44
so when I built this site when I was
121:47
thinking about building the site instead
121:48
of using any of the frameworks they have
121:50
out today and get a reaction view I was
121:52
just like well all I need to do is
121:53
display information so why would I make
121:55
it any more complicated than that
121:57
okay so this kind of inspired me to make
122:00
this site that is just your HTML CSS and
122:02
JavaScript and my own designs and yeah
122:07
so it is pretty simple I mean it's just
122:10
basically you know my information my
122:14
experience of whatever is in my work
122:16
that's all it is and yeah pretty up
122:21
about how it turned out
122:25
[Applause]
122:34
hey Cognito cool so I'm just gonna show
122:37
two sites this is my canonical site I
122:40
guess this is me largely I just want to
122:44
cut show like how all of this here is
122:45
actually an age card but it's like text
122:47
so you can read it but it's also
122:48
readable for computers I was gonna go
122:51
swap to us but don't think I want to do
122:53
that anyway
122:53
SWOT stands for the social where that's
123:01
I'm liking it there is a bit about
123:04
subscriptions yeah I just kinda wanted
123:10
Emma straight like how was I can still
123:11
joke on supposed to be nice in my
123:14
perspective yeah emojis location these
123:17
cars and stuff everybody I am Jay
123:31
Gregory McVerry calm I wish my name is
123:34
shorter because it's really hard to fit
123:36
on note cards so this is my site and it
123:41
is like Lily I do a couple static sites
123:44
and then put my social stream like
123:48
Jonathan unknown because it's just
123:53
everything just works their stuff so I
123:56
have fun like just get a couple fun
123:58
pages and I started playing with this
124:00
stuff because I had poetry in my head
124:01
and I had to get learned some CSS to get
124:03
the pictures in the words I haven't
124:05
gotten there yet
124:06
but I've been playing with my age card
124:08
and then I put in a lot of feeds of mine
124:11
because I post like 80 90 times a day so
124:13
he you add me to my reader then you
124:14
unsubscribing two minutes later so I
124:18
have a bunch of different feeds that
124:19
people can follow but what I am most
124:20
excited about is I am playing with Kirby
124:23
a little bit to do the same thing
124:25
because I literally was making every
124:27
single page so like I would change my
124:29
navigation and then I would go change it
124:30
well 97 times but I love Kirby because
124:35
it's just it's all those files get saved
124:39
Filan it's just PHP and really I'm using
124:41
it to learn PHP because I've never done
124:42
this stuff before and the documentation
124:45
to learn PHP doesn't really exist but I
124:47
need two things to learn passion versus
124:52
trying to watch a LinkedIn video or
124:53
youtube video so this is on Kirby and it
124:56
looks just like the same and I've been
124:57
slowly playing and got my notes to work
125:00
today just yesterday so I'm able to add
125:04
in my notes and I've got the card
125:06
pagination so I'm excited because I did
125:09
stuff I just use things that other
125:11
people go and just try to make it pretty
125:13
so now I want to be building all right
125:29
so I'm Tara I've been working on it
125:35
probably since November when I was lost
125:37
in Berlin right now it's using Grob
125:40
there's really nothing on it so this
125:43
week and I definitely want to try to do
125:44
it this is all template stuff except for
125:46
my gallery yeah there's not really much
125:50
wrong here but I want to definitely
125:51
implement a lot of the indie web stuff
125:53
for this yeah so hopefully I'll be able
125:56
to do that this weekend and pick a lot
125:58
of so my name is David Chen ski I
126:15
decided not to bring my laptop so that I
126:17
could talk for more time I can't talk
126:19
quite as fast as some people so this is
126:23
my website it is deliberately Spartan
126:25
it's white plain and that's because I
126:29
figured I would put as little on it as
126:30
possible and then allow you to look at a
126:32
whole bunch of other stuff should you
126:33
want to there are other people out there
126:36
who use the tools that I've built for
126:38
the India web since I do a lot of the
126:40
WordPress stuff more than I do but
126:41
whenever I go on trips I do a lot more
126:43
so I decided to try some check-ins since
126:45
I don't do that when I'm not at home I
126:47
took a picture see there I am
126:49
nothing I wrote about all the things I
126:51
packed to come here so if you want to
126:53
steal my bag you know exactly you get
126:56
and that's pretty much it for now I'll
127:01
leave now
127:04
[Applause]
127:19
my name's Don Park very sorts and
127:24
feature that hadn't seen mentioned yet
127:30
and that is how do you everybody
127:34
something everybody needs and nobody's
127:36
done that so far
127:37
I assume that people using HTTP logins
127:39
various things but there's India and
127:41
Meowth is quite useful where you
127:43
basically are using your trusted third
127:44
party to say just that and anyone can
127:51
log into my website just go there log in
127:53
it'll send you another fishing service
127:55
of course live demos never work but if
127:59
this we're working you'd see oh there we
128:00
go they look for rel me links back to
128:03
whatever service is on a list of
128:04
approved services which some Aaron Preki
128:07
code is running right now to display
128:08
that and you click through and if I were
128:11
logged into any of those services here I
128:12
would come back and instead of this
128:13
field here and say you're logged in and
128:15
it's a it's like an indie based way to
128:18
login okay who's next ups I think we
128:29
have run out of people in the line
128:36
I haven't actually done a demo yet so
128:39
good morning I'm Eric raggy I just want
128:43
to show one quick thing about my website
128:45
my website is Aaron PK comm the last
128:48
thing I did on this website was a minor
128:51
optimization because I noticed that on
128:54
some of the posts they get a lot of
128:56
likes or comments trying to find one
129:01
that had a lot of hair this one all of
129:05
these little avatars we're starting to
129:07
actually bog down the page size quite a
129:09
bit and what I did was thanks to some
129:14
clever code from Zack leet I basically
129:17
just copy this code it was great um
129:19
they're lazy loaded down so you can when
129:22
i refresh you can probably see this
129:23
flicker so if i refresh you see how they
129:25
were all gray placeholders and they
129:27
loaded in asynchronously and um I did
129:32
that for the avatars that was what he
129:33
had done for the avatars and then I was
129:35
like this actually would make a lot of
129:36
sense for a reader as well so I've used
129:40
monocle when I'm when I'm like on the
129:43
road and on my phone and on bad Wi-Fi
129:45
train Wi-Fi and so I had that code to
129:49
monocle as well which I came all going
129:52
to show you but it's the same thing so
129:53
now all of the images and monocle lazy
129:55
loaded as well which means you actually
129:56
see content faster and even actually
129:58
interact with the pages before the
130:00
images load which is great so it's
130:01
helped make it a lot more usable when
130:03
I'm on really terrible internet thanks I
130:16
just wanted to say thanks everyone for
130:19
your patience earlier I fixed my website
130:23
so here it is
130:26
it's Marty McGuire would that's my name
130:28
with a dot before the re because com was
130:30
taken and we can you can see
130:38
[Laughter]
130:41
so yeah I'm just gonna leave it on there
130:52
while we okay we have seven minutes left
130:56
in intros time magically
130:58
last call for demos anyone want to give
131:01
a quick demo of their site anyone want
131:04
to come up and say what they would like
131:06
to do on their site like notes no demo
131:08
at all this is this is perfect
131:20
so I Mitch I have a couple domains but
131:23
the one that I use the most is suited up
131:26
coffee and this is my website so that's
131:31
kind of my goal for today yes I'm
131:38
looking forward to more so a website
131:52
been like something I've been trying to
131:56
get at the site someone to UM in New
131:58
York but like the way I like it
132:01
that make sense it's very I had it for
132:04
an I should come over like it was like
132:05
just this no need to put this there but
132:08
yeah there's like things there's things
132:13
I want to add to it like making it
132:15
easier to find right well okay but just
132:26
what I'll be able to log in here but I
132:27
remember like I can't on this computer
132:30
so hopefully yeah it'll be like a whole
132:36
[Applause]
132:38
I'm sorry I'm not logging to everyone
132:43
next time delegated login right yeah
132:46
okay we have five minutes left
132:49
going once last call for personal site
132:51
demos as you can see any state of site
132:55
is hello I'm Ariana and very new to all
133:11
of this as in most of the stuff has
133:12
never even occurred to me so at the very
133:14
beginning stages of thinking through all
133:16
of this and I guess when interested in
133:20
learning today other than everything is
133:22
how to sort of negotiate personal site
133:25
and want it to be sort of a collective
133:27
and working more plurally so I'm
133:29
building currently a design practice a
133:32
collective with a partner and we believe
133:35
we produce more super work you know that
133:37
apart hence superorganism so we're
133:39
trying to sort of figure out what that
133:41
looks like and I'm intrigued by what
133:43
that looks like on the indie web and
133:45
sort of how to build my own content and
133:48
myself while also building this
133:50
collective and sort of negotiating back
133:56
[Applause]
134:06
ok I think I think that's it for intros
134:08
we're gonna call it with four minutes
134:10
left somehow we are ahead of schedule
134:12
ok y'all are awesome clearly thanks to
134:15
all of you with your personal site that
134:17
was being so fast and furious ok we the
134:20
next item in the agenda is the group
134:23
photo which takes place according to the
134:26
schedule in four minutes as any pointed
134:33
out that gives you a little bit of prep
134:35
time Aaron is going to be art directing
134:37
you in the photo so I'm going to leave
134:39
it up to him so two awards that I'm
134:45
going to point the camera turn this
134:46
camera around and point it towards the
134:47
kitchen
134:48
the couches will be in the photo and
134:51
will have people sitting on those chairs
134:52
and then standing behind the chairs so
134:55
go ahead and yeah top people in the back
135:00
or tell people sitting tell people in
135:03
the back if you don't want to be in the
135:07
photo that's also totally fine just stay
135:09
out of the photo I come to the side of
135:10
the room and yeah here so thanks

      <description>Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t resolve an issue, contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked to leave.</description>

      <title>FreeNode IRC #indieweb-dev on IIW RWoT and DID&#39;s</title>

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for is that folk in the DID community will consider integrating with IndieAuth. This would enable easy adoption for website owners, and make the logical connection between DID and IndieAuth.</description>

      <description>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users’ data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indigo is a lightweight theme for &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org&#34;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; features baked in. It&amp;rsquo;s great for longer-form blogging, placing its focus on distraction-free reading and beautiful typefaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

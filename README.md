This is the old readme for web-work tools... needs updating now that indieweb is it's own separate site branching off.

# [Webwork.tools](https://web-work.tools)

This blog is where I document my journey as an independent web-worker, and will grow to include contributions from other indie workers of the web.

This page has some samples of content that I've created for others, as well as general resources for web-work.

Originally it wasn't in blog form... but I just looked on github, to see when I started, and chose the date that way, for each.
